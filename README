FOrmal Real-Time Scheduler (FORTS)
FORTS is a model checker on Linear Hybrid Automata that I write in C++. The basic parts of FORTS compose a parser to read LHA models in script inputs and an engine to perform reachability analysis for the safety property. It is specialized for Real-Time Scheduling problems.
