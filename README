FOrmal Real-Time Scheduler (FORTS)
FORTS is a model checker on Linear Hybrid Automata (LHA) that I write in C++. The basic parts of FORTS compose a parser to read LHA models in script inputs and an engine to perform reachability analysis for the safety property. It is specialized for Real-Time Scheduling problems.

* Compliation
    --- automake --add-missing 
    --- autoreconf
    --- ./configure
    --- make

* Examples on input models for FORTS can be found in directory "models".

* To perform a plain reachability analysis in the LHA model, simply run
        ./efforts input-file
        or 
        ./efforts -s origin input-file

* For Multiprocessor Global Fixed-Priority Schedulability Analysis
** The python script  "forts-gen-smp-sched.py" generates the scheduling model in LHA given an input description
        python forts-gen-smp-sched.py num-of-processors task-set-description-in-json output-file-name
** To trigger the efficient schedulability analysis with "slack-time weak simulation relation", run
        ./efforts -s widened_ex input-file
