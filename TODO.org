#+TITLE: todo list for effort
#+author: Giuseppe Lipari and Youcheng Sun

* TODO As a first step, we do the model [0%]
  Copy from old efforts. We need classes 
  - Automaton
  - Location
  - Edges
  - Guard 
  - Expression
  We need to prepare a way to create such objects that is independent from the parser

** TODO Transform Expression into a class
*** TODO Write a constructor 
*** TODO Write methods to read/write the components
*** TODO Write a method "eval" which evaluates the expression for some value of the variables
*** TODO Write test cases for it
   
** TODO Write class AtomicConstraint
   - A comparison between two expressions
*** TODO Write a method eval()
*** TODO Write test cases

** TODO Write a class Constraint
   It is a conjunction of AtomicConstraints
*** TODO Write a method eval()
*** TODO Write test cases

** TODO PPL
*** TODO Write a function to transform a Constraint into a PPL polyhedron, or octogonal shape, or DBM
*** TODO Write tests   
   
** TODO Write a class Update 
   It is an assignment 
   It contains a variable and an expression

** TODO Write class Variable 
   represents a clock

** TODO Write class DiscreteVariable
   Represent a discrete variable
